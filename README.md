# Life-Expectancy-Prediction


The benefit of knowing life expectancy is to evaluate the performance of the government in improving the welfare of the population in general and improving economic, education, and health status in particular. Moreover, population aging is often depicted as a challenge to economic progress and to the sustainability of public budgets. If global life expectancy is projected to increase, and countries and society do not adjust laws and norms, survival beyond a certain “old age” will be less convenient. When appropriate policies are put in place, population aging can in fact benefit economic development and economic progress. Governments and organizations such as the United Nations (UN) can harness population aging for economic progress and ensure economic security in old age by, for example, embracing diversity in a newly defined old age, removing barriers to access decent work, and improving access to social protection. Those adjustments in policies will impact every single individual.


This project models the UN diving into different macro-factors provided from World Health Organization (WHO) dataset 2014 for a linear regression prediction of life expectancy. Note that due to the complex dynamics of the pandemic from 2020, the prediction only claims to hold validation in exclusion of direct pandemic effects on people’s life span. Data of 2014 was used as it is the closest year with full accessible data.
